Our research introduces a new method to address commonsense reasoning in question answering. By combining neural networks and symbolic reasoning, we've developed a hybrid AI system. We extract symbolic knowledge from text and train an RNN with external knowledge bases. Our approach demonstrates a unique way of answering questions that require commonsense reasoning, advancing AI systems' ability to reason and comprehend context.
