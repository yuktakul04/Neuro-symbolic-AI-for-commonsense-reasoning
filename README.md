This research work develops a new framework that combines patient feedback with evidence-based best practices across disease states to improve drug recommendations. It employs BERT as its free-text processing engine to deal with sentiment judgment and classification. The functionality of the system, named `PharmaBERT`,  includes acceptance of drug review data as a comprehensive input, drug categorization when dealing with a wide range of treatments and fine-tuning the BERT-based model for gaining positive or negative sentiment towards specific medications. PharmaBERT categorizes various drugs and fine-tunes the BERT structure to perceive lots of possible sentiments for particular medications. Consequently, PharmaBERT brings all its training, and optimization capabilities together and through this, system reaches a higher accuracy of up to 91% thus showcasing the potency of the model in capturing patient sentiments. While being a BERT spin-off, PharmaBERT utilizes its own set of experienced techniques to comprehend and sense the health-related text input given by the patient, doctor, or pharmacist. It uses transfer learning, that is, it learns from language representations to adapt quickly to the intricacies of drug reviewing. Through PharmaBERT, healthcare professionals may expand their diagnoses with insights from patient feedback to constitute more neutral decisions.
